 1.
Open terminal to create ssh keys:
cd ~                 #Your home directory
ssh-keygen -t rsa    #Press enter for all values

 2.
Give the git administrator your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub key and next time you push, no password required.

 
For Windows (Only works if the commit program is capable of using certificates/private & public ssh keys)
 1.Use Putty Gen to generate a key
 2.Export the key as an open SSH key
 3.Give the git administrator your id_rsa.pub
 
For a walkthrough on putty gen for the above steps, please see http://ask-leo.com/how_do_i_create_and_use_public_keys_with_ssh.html.

On Windows: If you are using the git bash window the terminal commands also work. The only thing is you must be certain you want to overwrite the default id_rsa file, and you must type y when prompted if you want to overwrite the current id_rsa key.–  Agustín AmenabarMay 6 '13 at 19:49
